# Practical Work 2 - Working with Node modules

_The student must create a Node.js project to implement methods which process JSON files._

## Main goals

-   Implement a Node.js project
-   Asynchronous processing mutiple files
-   Working with JSON

## SOW - Statement of work

The file Estados.json is a list within all federative units (UF) of Brazil; each one represented by an ID. In the file Cidades.json there is an almost complete list of cities of Brazil with their respective state represented by its ID, reffering to Estados.json.

### Activities

1.  - [ ] download estados.json and cidades.json from the [this link](https://github.com/felipefdl/cidades-estados-brasil-json);

2.  - [ ] Create a function that writes an "UF.json" for each state.
3.  - [ ] Create a function that pass the "UF" as argument and reads the corresponding UF.json, returning the amount of cities from that state.

## Rules

-   Do not amend the name of cities in the original object.
-   When the project runs, it should execute its methods in sequence and end the process.
